# Airbnb Price Prediction :house:

Looking for a fair-priced Airbnb listing to book? Are you a real estate firm or Airbnb host seeking to set competitive prices?

Artificial Intelligence is surely the way to go! :robot:

In this Quantitative Economics Bachelor Thesis, Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms are used to accurately predict Airbnb rental prices.

Two datasets for Los Angeles city are retrieved from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/): listings data and the reviews dataset.

Combining custom functions, transfer learning and Open Source AI frameworks such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow and Pytorch, several AI models are built to help economic agents make informed decisions.

A Bayesian perspective is taken to perform statistical inference, hyperparameter tuning and data modeling.

Additionally, XAI methods are used to overcome the black box problem of AI models.
